                        <p>SIAT Interface Design combines the art and design of human-computer interfaces to test the issues of interactivity in technological systems. This project was completed by me and two other group members on Adobe XD. The goal of the application was to create a prototype of an app of our choice that used at least one of the phones sensors, taking into consideration feasibility, and user research.
                        <br><br>Our project,   <a href="https://youtu.be/lPf7Ztdylvg?list=LL">Summit for Whistler Ski Mountain</a> was created as a community-based reviewing system for the trails on Whistler Mountain. Users are able to track their location on the mountain with the phone's GPS and comment on the conditions and difficulties of the trails so that other skiers and snowboarders have a safer and easier time navigating through the slopes.

                        <h3>Concept & Research</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                          Our initial app designs were very broad and tried to incorporate all aspects of ski and snowboard trails apps on the market. Here we found that there were many apps that focused on either the weather of the mountain or the tracking of an individualâ€™s ski runs, but there were no applications that handled user-reviews well.
                          <br><br>Thus, we decided to center our application around a detailed page of each ski run on Whistler Ski Mountain where users can find out more details of the trails from other users. Originally, our app was going to be a more general ski trail application for all ski trails but for the scope of the project we decided to focus on Whistler.

                          <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
                          <br>
                          <p>
                          Our final prototype took all of our previous iterations into account from class feedback and user testing.
                          The consensus was that our final design needed to be simple and quick to use while out in the cold mountains and be accessible for users of all skill levels.
                          For beginner riders we had the trails difficulties tailored to their skill level while also providing the necessary filtering options for the experts to find the right trail for them.
